# Shopify metafield CLI

A little Python script to batch download Shopify metafields.  (Coming Real Soon
Nowâ„¢: upload!)

## Why?

From [shopify.dev](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/liquid/reference/objects/metafield),

> The metafields object allows you to store additional information for
> products, collections, customers, orders, blogs, pages and your shop. You can
> output metafields on your storefront using Liquid.

Great!  And we'll find this in the admin web interface like all the other
shop content, right?  Wait... no?

> There are several apps in the [Shopify App
> Store](https://apps.shopify.com/search/query?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=metafield) that
> you can use to manage your metafields.
